**Summary**

`npm-to-yarn` is designed to convert NPM CLI commands to their Yarn equivalents (and vice versa).

## Why `npm-to-yarn`?

`npm-to-yarn` is super helpful in documentation, for example in generating code tabs.

## üìú Docs

```js
import convert from 'npm-to-yarn'

// or
// var convert = require('npm-to-yarn')

convert('npm install squirrelly', 'yarn')

// yarn add squirrelly
```

 */
