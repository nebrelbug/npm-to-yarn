**Summary**

`npm-to-yarn` is designed to convert NPM CLI commands to their Yarn equivalents (and vice versa).

## Why `npm-to-yarn`?

`npm-to-yarn` is super helpful in documentation, for example in generating code tabs.

## üìú Docs

```js
import { convert, convertMultiple } from 'npm-to-yarn'

// or
// var convert = require('npm-to-yarn')

convert('npm install squirrelly', 'yarn')
// yarn add squirrelly

// npx conversions
convert('npx create-next-app', 'yarn')
// yarn dlx create-next-app

// one to many conversions
convertMultiple("npm i next", ["pnpm", "bun"])
// ["pnpm add next", "bun add next"]

// many to one
convertMultiple(["npm i eslint", "pnpm add react"], "yarn")
// ["yarn add eslint", "yarn add react"]

// many to many
convertMultiple(["bun add rollup", "npm i express"], ["yarn", "pnpm"])
/*
[
    ["yarn add rollup", "yarn add express"], 
    ["pnpm add rollup", "pnpm add express"]
]
*/

```

`npm-to-yarn` exposes a UMD build, so you can also install it with a CDN (it exposes global variable `n2y`)

### API

```ts
/**
 * Converts between npm and yarn command
 */
export function convert (str: string, to: Command): string
export function convertMultiple = (str: string | string[], to: Command | Command[]): string[] 
```

## ‚úîÔ∏è Tests

Tests can be run with `npm test`. Multiple tests check that parsing, rendering, and compiling return expected results, formatting follows guidelines, and code coverage is at the expected level.
